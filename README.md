# Inform V2

Due to the amount of issues I had with Inform V1, I decided to completely rewrite the project. Many of the same elements will be retained however, this time, I plan on using the new skills that I have since gained to make this a reasonably usable and interesting application. I'm using the same stack with most of the same libraries as the previous version. This is still a very rough version and many features are still missing. However, I work on this fairly often so expect regular updates.

You can find an older version of this app that is pretty much complete and finished [here](https://github.com/vdoubleu/Inform).
